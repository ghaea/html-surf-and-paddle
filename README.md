## Layout - Surf and Paddle

Surf and Paddle is an Iron Yard week 1 tradition that takes a designer's mockup image into a webpage using HTML and CSS.  This project demonstrates an understanding of the use of different HTML tags along with the  'position' and 'display' properties in CSS.  It also utilizes Google fonts, Sip color picker, and PerfectPixel Chrome extension.
