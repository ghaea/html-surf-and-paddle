## Layout - Surf and Paddle

### My Approach

I started by putting all the content into the HTML.  With the CSS, I started with the header and worked my way down to get the basic spacing and colors in place.  Lastly, I worked on the details such as text padding and hover states.

### Project Description/Instruction

A tradition like no other. Surf and Paddle, on Thursday of Week 1.

One of the basic, foundational skills in being a professional web developer is the translation of a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. For this project, we hired a designer to create a professional-looking landing page for a theoretical surf shop. Pixel precision will be important.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the properties and use of many HTML tags
* Understand and be able to leverage many different CSS properties to style content
* Be comfortable with implementing layouts of HTML within CSS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* The `position` property and it's values
* The `display` property and it's values
* Google Fonts and Normalize CSS
* The Sip color picker

## Details

All of the assets you need will be in the `assets/images` folder.

Make sure you use a CSS reset, it'll help with positioning.

We're going to use Google web fonts for this assignment. The header font is [Oswald](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Oswald) and the font for the main content is [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans).

## Normal Mode

Convert the mockup image (`surf-paddle.png`) into a living, breathing website. This needs to be as pixel-perfect (in terms of position, font, color, spacing, borders, everything) as you can make it.

I'll be using the PerfectPixel Chrome extension to compare your page to the mockup image; you should do the same as you're nearing completion.
